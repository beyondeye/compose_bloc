/**
 *
 * [BlocSelector] is analogous to [BlocBuilder] but allows to select parts of the full Bloc state,
 * or in general some value derived from one or more fields of the full Bloc state. This is
 * the value that will be passed to the [content] composable, and recomposition will be triggered
 * not by change of the full bloc state but instead of this derived value.
 *
 * An optional [blocTag] parameter can be specified in order to identify a specific
 * bloc instance in the case where there is more than one instance of a bloc of the same type
 * registered for the current composable subtree (see [BlocProvider])
 * [blocTag] parameter is not present in the original flutter_bloc implementation
 *
 * **Note**: the selected value must be immutable in order for [BlocSelector]
 * to accurately determine whether [content] should be called again.
 * TODO understand why and check if BlocSelector work as expected
