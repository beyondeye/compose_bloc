/**
 * [BlocListener] handles retrieving a bloc of the specified type from the registered blocs in the
 * current composable subtree (see [BlocProvider]) and start listening to the associated stream of
 * bloc state updates. Invoke [listener] callback in response to `state` changes in the [Bloc].
 * Note that [listener] is not a Composable. It is  a (potentially) suspendable method,
 * that is invoked with [LaunchedEffect]
 *
 * The [listener] is guaranteed to only be called once for each `state` change
 * unlike the `content` method in [BlocBuilder], that can be triggered because of recomposition
 * of the current composable tree
 *
 * An optional [blocTag] parameter can be specified in order to identify a specific
 * bloc instance in the case where there is more than one instance of a bloc of the same type
 * registered for the current composable subtree (see [BlocProvider])
 * The [blocTag] parameter is not present in the original flutter_bloc implementation *
 *
 * An optional [listenWhen] parameter can be provided for more granular control
 * over when [listener] is called.
 * [listenWhen] takes the previous `state` and current `state` and must
 * return a [Boolean] which determines whether or not the [listener] function
 * will be invoked.
 * For the first call to [listenWhen] the previous `state` will be initialized to the `state` of the [Bloc]
 * when the [BlocListener] was initialized.
 * NOTE: in original DART code BlocListener is a Widget that declare a child.
 * In Compose there is no need to do such a thing. By removing the child argument
 * Also there is actually no need for the MultiBlocListener class that is present in flutter_bloc code
